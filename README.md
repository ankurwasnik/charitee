# Charitee [ProjectLink](https://github.com/ankurwasnik/charitee)
## Application Overview
The application is going to help a beneficiary, such as non-profit, or any other entity that may be looking for charity or funding.\
The beneficiary will have an address set up on a service like [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com) so that they can easily sell the ether and convert it to INR. With the Ethereum address being managed by Coinbase, the beneficiary will not have access to the private keys and therefore cannot interact with a DApp from that address.\
The custodian address is the ethereum address that either the beneficiary controls directly or someone operating on behalf of the beneficiary will own. This address can interact with a DApp, and it is the address that will be given the ability to issue the transaction that will transfer funds collected by the Fundraiser contract to the beneficiary address.

## Application Design
There will be following pages.\
- Homepage
- Creating a new fundraiser
- Fundraiser details page
- Donation receipt page
